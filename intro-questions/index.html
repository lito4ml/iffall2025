    <h1>Manuel Lopez's Intro!</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>My name is Manuel Lopez.  I am a junior with a Communication Design Major and a Classics Minor</li>
        <li>My background is primarily in illustration with some 2D and 3D animation, and I'm taking this class as a major requirement. </li>
        <li>My only experience is from Typography I last year, where we adapted one of our printed assignments into a webpage.</li>
        <li>In this class I think I want to learn how to do some animation on a webpage, though maybe that's biting off more than I can chew...</li>
        <li>I imagine that color, type size, and any graphics might be approached differently, and particularly color and graphics I would like to learn more about.</li>
        <li><a href="https://https://teenage.engineering/">This website</a> I thought was very well designed. It is selling pretty complicated hardware, but is very clean and modern.
            It looks good on both mobile and computer, though the web design is different on both. Even the color scheme matches the products. It's a little spacey, a little futuristic,
            which I think is characteristic of synthesizers. Overall, the site matches the product and the feelings they want to associate the product with. </li>
        <li>It's super basic, but frankly I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> might be the best example of a simply informational 
            website. It's clear, its easy to follow information, there's no pop-ups, and it's table of contents and small table of information work well to quickly
            transmit information. I think my favorite part of the site is that when you hover over hyperlinks in the content, you are presented
            with a short excerpt from the article on the site, meaning you can quickly check the meanings of terms, concepts, or other things that are referenced 
            in an article without going to a new page. </li>
        <li>I found <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football">this website</a> when I mentioned this question to a friend. I clicked on it and suddenly
            I was engrossed in this story I knew nothing about. The way you scoll to pass the time, the pacing of it all, the twist at the beginning, I just was 
            blown away. It's nothing that crazy coding-wise I'm sure, but what it is trying to do, it does incredibly. If I look at the html it looks like it'd be 
            basic stuff, and maybe it's because I'm writing this and experiencing the website to late, but my mind is blown.</li>
