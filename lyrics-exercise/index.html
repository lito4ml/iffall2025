                Hit 'em with a little bit of 
                <br>dopamine to keep 'em lookin'
                <br>Every second, they'll be second
                <br>guessing, trying to meet the
                <br>Expectation of the age of
                <br>information, the simulation 
                <br>Will be so convincing, they'll
                <br>forget that <em>they're alive.</em>
                <br>
                <br>Hit 'em with a little bit of

            <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
            <p class="linc">
                I can feel it slipping away
                <br>My grip on reality's 
                <br>down to a couple fingers
                <br>Living like I'm running a race,
                <br>though I've my doubts
                <br>Anyone's gonna come out the winner
            </p>
            <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p class="linc">
                Wake up and break yourself outta here
                <br>Don't be one of the poor souls  
                <br>who disappears
                <br>Stop believing and telling the lie
                <br>Why don't you look your life in the eye?
            </p>
            <h3>Verse</h3>
            <p class="linc">
                Show a video of a corgi
                <br>wearing a knitted sweater
                <br>Then an advertisement for a 
                <br>pair of shoes that look much better
                <br>Than the fourteen they already have,
                <br>besides they're vegan leather
                <br>They'll be so delighted, they'll
                <br>forget that <em>they're alive.</em>
            </p>
            <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
            <p class="linc">
                Giving pieces of me away
                <br>My death comes by a thousand cuts,
                <br>and I paid for the knife
                <br>Bleeding for a way to escape
                <br>my ball and chain
                <br>The fatal clutches of father screen time
            </p>
            <h3>Chorus</h3>
            <p class="linc">
                Wake up and break yourself outta here

                <br>who disappears
                <br>Stop believing and telling the lie
                <br>Why don't you look your life in the eye?
                <br>Wake up and break yourself outta here
                <br>Don't be one of the poor souls  
                <br>who disappears
                <br>Stop believing and telling the lie
