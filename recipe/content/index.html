    <h1>Inspiration Sites:</h1>
    <h2>Recipe Sites:</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.livewellbakeoften.com/soft-chewy-oatmeal-chocolate-chip-cookies/">Live Well Bake Often</a> uses a very segmented structure, with a box around the recipe further down (and a button to jump right to it), ways to mark off ingredients, good seperation and hierarchy of information in the box which is helped by the mixing of serif and sans serif, and visually just a consistent color scheme and visual treatment. I also like the side column, and have been considering using one of those in my website as well.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/">King Arthur Baking</a>'s homepage almost reminds me of the Apple store. I think the density of information is very well thoughtout, and i like the big header before breaking into progressively smaller boxes. The  recipe's themselves feature all the ingredients in a sidebar, which is actually how <em>I</em> was intending to use a side column, though I would want to try and make it fixed so you can see the ingredients anywhere in the recipe.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.recipetineats.com//">Recipe Tin Eats</a> incorperates the great idea of photographs of ingredients. I think not only does this help with clarity, but it's easier to know if you have everything (in my opinion) if you can see everything. Missing a small dish of salt? Now you know! It also has pictures for each step, which helps a lot as well. </p>

    <h2>Non-Recipe Sites:</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.devolverdigital.com/">Devolver Digital</a>'s site is quite nice, featuring a very clear color scheme and font consistency. Information is easily accessible, and also looks really good on mobile, which might be fun to try and achieve.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.stonesthrow.com/">Stones Throw</a> Is another site that looks good on mobile, but on computer im quite fond of the responsive hover states. Not very busy, which could be good to emulate.</p>
    <p><a href="https://ohm.studio/">OHM</a> Is a furniture store website, and I like a lot of what's hapenning here. Specifically I'm drawn to the different scrolling speeds, but that might be something more related to javascript. I will say, it becomes almost hard to navigate at times though, because everything takes (in my opinion) a liiiiiittle too long to scroll and appear on screen. </p>
